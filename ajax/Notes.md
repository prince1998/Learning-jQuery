* Ajax stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
* It allows you to make requests behind the scene so you dont have to refresh the page and can update certain components of application. You can use this to get other HTML pages, fetch JSON and make POST requests,etc.
* To load another HTML file, we can use the load() function, but it has certain limitations
